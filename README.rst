relativity
==========
multi-index data structures


Motivation
----------

We're going to take a mental journey of discovery to see why
relativity was written, and how you can use it to simplify
some of the most difficult problems that come up regularly
when programming.  Rather then leaping straight from programming
with python's standard data structures to programming with
relativistic data structures, we'll get a running start
by programming in a version of python that is missing
key data structures.  Then, we will draw a line from this
deficient bad version of python to regular python, and
then extend that line on into relativity.

Imagine programming without hashmaps.  For example, let's say we have
a list of ``Restaurant`` objects and ``City`` objects, and we want to
get how many ``Restaurants`` are in each ``City``.

Normally this is simple:


.. code-block:: python

    from collections import Counter

    restaurants_in_city = Counter()

    for restaurant in restaurants:
        restaurants_in_city[restaurant.address.city] += 1

    def get_restaurant_count(city):
        return restaurants_in_city[city]


But, imagine how you would approach the problem if the only available
data structure was a list.


.. code-block:: python

    cities = []
    restaurants_in_city = []

    for restaurant in restaurants:
        for idx, city in enumerate(cities):
            if city == restaurant.city:
                restaurants_in_city[idx] += 1
                break
        else:
            cities.append(restaurant.city)
            restaurants_in_city.append(1)

    def get_restaurant_count(city):
        for idx, city2 in enumerate(cities):
            if city == city2:
                return restaurants_in_city[idx]
        return 0


Comparing the two examples, there are a few key differences:

- without dicts, there are many more loops
- these loops also require low-value iteration variables
- single data structures split into multiple, which must
  then be kept in sync

Let's leave this dystopian data structure wasteland behind
for now and go back to regular python.

The same differences that showed up when programming with
and without hashmaps will come up again when comparing
programming with single-index hashmaps to relativistic
multi-index hashmaps.


Design Philosophy
-----------------


DB Feature Sets
'''''''''''''''

A typical SQL database, such as PostGres, MySQL, SQLServer, Oracle, or DB2
offers many features which can be split into four categories:

- relational data model and queries
- network protocol and multiple concurrent connections
- transactions, atomic updates, and MVCC_
- persistent storage, backups, and read replicas

Let's call these "relational", "network", "transactional",
and "persistence" feature sets.

.. _MVCC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control


"Alternative" Databases
'''''''''''''''''''''''

The most widely used alternative is probably SQLite_.  SQLite
has relational, transactional, and persistence feature sets but does not have
a network protocol.  Instead it must be embedded_
as a library inside another application.

Another example is the venerable ZODB_.  ZODB has
network, transactional, and persistence feature sets
but replaces the relational data model
with an object data model.

As an extreme example of how less can be more, memcached_ has
only network features.  Data is stored ephemerally in the form of opaque blobs without
any data model.  There is no atomicity of updates: there is no way to ensure that
two writes either both succeed or both fail.

The so-called "NoSQL" databases (cassandra_, couchdb_, mongodb_, etc)
generally provide network and persistence features but lack a relational data model
and transactionality.

Relativity: Relational Ã  la carte
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In this design space, Relativity offers a relational feature set and nothing else.
Relativity allows you to build in-memory data structures that represent relationships
among arbitrary Python objects and then execute queries over those objects and
relationships via a very natural and pythonic API.
